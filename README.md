# Asterosleuth

This is a repo for trying to set up a code snippet for accessing various online archives for information about a star. 

The idea is it should be able to take any simbad-resolvable target ID and access, e.g., the Gaia DR2 archive and retrieve that archive entry. Similarly for KIC, EPIC, TIC targets and maybe more in future (GRD1, GRD3, PanSTARRS)
